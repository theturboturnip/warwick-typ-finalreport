\label{sec:Implementation}

Building the program was a huge technical challenge on many levels, resulting in 8.5k lines of code spread over 146 files in three different programming languages.% involving three programming languages, % resulting in 8.5k lines of code built with three programming languages 
Solving the more complicated problems required some interesting tricks which may have interacted with lesser-known language features, memory models, and in one case the particulars of the C++17 specification.
The correctness of the resulting program was then ensured through the use of other features, including C++ macros and files that crossed language boundaries\footnote{See \cref{sec:Impl:Viz:CPUGPUSafety}.}.
This chapter documents these tricks and the background needed to understand them.

The first section contains an overview of relevant C++ features, and some other concepts employed while developing the program.
The next section focuses on Code Safety, detecting any faults during compilation and then ensuring any other faults do not then manifest into problematic errors.
As in the Design section, each layer of the codebase is then examined and all interesting problems solved during development are documented.
