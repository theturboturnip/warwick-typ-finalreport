\section{Visualization Layer}\label{sec:ImplementationViz}
\subsection{Multithreading}
The worker thread is implemented with a \mintinline{cpp}{SystemWorker} class combined with a generic threading system.
% While only one worker thread is ever used in the final program, earlier versions planned to use a few unique workers so a generic system was required.
An \mintinline{cpp}{IWorkerThread} virtual interface is defined and \mintinline{cpp}{IWorkerThread_Impl<Worker>} implements this for a specific \mintinline{cpp}{Worker} class, similar to the Simulation Runners pattern.
% A similar pattern to Simulation Runners is used, where an \mintinline{cpp}{IWorkerThread} virtual interface is defined and a \mintinline{cpp}{IWorkerThread\_Impl<Worker>} class implements this for a specific \mintinline{cpp}{Worker} class.

% The \mintinline{cpp}{IWorkerThread} class works with a \mintinline{cpp}{WorkerThreadController} class.
To kick off the worker thread, a \mintinline{cpp}{WorkerThreadController} writes to a mutex-protected set of input data.
The `work index' of this data is incremented to signal it is new, and a condition variable is signalled to alert the worker thread and begin processing.
Work cannot be enqueued until the thread produces an output, which is sent to the main thread in the same way as before - a mutex is taken to update the output data with the new index, and the condition variable is signalled in case the main thread is waiting for the worker to finish.

\subsection{GPU Work Breakdown}
% \todoref{GPU work breakdown design} showed a coarse breakdown of work between the Viz Compute and Viz Graphics stages, which \cref{fig:VizDataTransform} expands on.
\cref{fig:VizDataTransform} expands on the coarse GPU work breakdown from \cref{sec:Design:Viz:Breakdown}.
Each rectangle represents a piece of memory, and each arrow represents a transformation from input to output via a compute shader, an image layout transfer, or a graphics pipeline.
Most memory is global rather than per-frame, as the system does not run any visualization stages in parallel.
Some per-frame memory is used to allow race-free accesses at record-time.
These buffers allow user interaction, such as moving the particle emitters and setting the quantity ranges, and are highlighted in bold.

Image layout transfers allow the GPU to optimize access times for an image by changing the format it's stored in.
Images are transferred to the \mintinline{cpp}{ShaderReadOnlyOptimal} layout (listed as `Texture' rather than `Image' in \cref{fig:VizDataTransform}) for efficient sampling at arbitrary points, and kept in the \mintinline{cpp}{General} layout when accessed at 2D data arrays (see \cref{fig:VizImageRead} as a comparison).

Memory barriers (not shown in \cref{fig:VizDataTransform}) are inserted between every compute shader to ensure any required data written from a previous shader is visible to the next shader.\todocite{That website that explains memory barriers}
% On top of that, each compute shader requires at least one \emph{memory barrier}, to ensure any data written in previous stages is visible to the next stage.
These memory barriers are quite granular, as shown in \cref{fig:VizMemoryBarrier}.

The particle system implentation in \cref{fig:VizDataTransform} is a simplified view for compactness, \cref{fig:VizDataParticles} shows a full breakdown of this subsystem.
This maintains three growable/shrinkable lists, plus a buffer containing particle positions.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Draw list, a list of particle indices to draw on screen
    \item The Inactive list, a list of inactive particle indices
    \item The Simulate list, a list of particle indices which take part in Simulation.
\end{enumerate}
The previous Draw list is the authority on which pariticles currently exist, and is used for the Kickoff shader to determine how many particles will be emitted/simulated\footnote{This isn't known at record time, because the last frame may still be simulating the particles}.
It is also copied into the Simulate particle list, which is grown by the Emit Particles shader.
The particles are then moved by the Simulate Particles shader as shown in \cref{sec:Research:Viz:Particles}.
These particles are added to the inactive list if out-of-bounds, and the new Draw list otherwise.
% adding particles to the inactive list if they move out of the simulation bounds, and moving all other particles to the new Draw list.
