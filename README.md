# warwick-typ-finalreport

Compiled with XeLaTeX 2020, but *should* be compatible with pdfLaTeX?

Based on the Warwick Report template on Overleaf:
[https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/university-of-warwick-report-template/kfpfvcbkdcdk](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/university-of-warwick-report-template/kfpfvcbkdcdk)

Important pages:
- `FinalReport.tex`, which includes all the other chapters
- `final_refs.bib`, the actual bibliography

Each chapter has its own folder.
The number in `ChXX` is just for ordering purposes, for example `Ch48Implementation` isn't the 48th chapter, but it's between `Ch42Design` and `Ch50ProjectManagement`.

The figures for each chapter are included in that chapter's folder, for example `Ch42Design/figures/FinalReport_VizWork.pdf`.

Some pages have draft versions, e.g. `Ch10Introduction/Introduction_d1.tex` is the first draft of the introduction.
The latest version doesn't have a draft number, e.g. `Ch10Introduction/Introduction.tex`.
