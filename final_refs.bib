Using a divide-and-conquer approach to generate inter-slice connectivity, we create a case table that defines triangle topology. The algorithm processes the 3D medical data in scan-line order and calculates triangle vertices using linear interpolation. We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data. Results from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) illustrate the quality and functionality of marching cubes.

This is based on the simplified Marker and cell technique, but it has a number of novel features. A user-supplied data file of coordinates prescribes the fluid domain which can be quite general and needs only to be connected. With a view to parallelisation the momentum equations are solved explicitly, but an automatic step-changing routine optimises the stability restriction. A conjugate gradient solver is used to invert the discrete Poisson equation. An accurate approximation to the stress conditions on the free surface is adopted. The code is written in structured FORTRAN with features from FORTRAN 90. The efficacy of the code is illustrated by applying it to some industrial problems.},

    abstract = {This paper discusses the comprehensive performance profiling, improvement and benchmarking of a Computational Fluid Dynamics code, one of the Grand Challenge applications, on three popular multiprocessors. In the process of analyzing performance we considered language, compiler, architecture, and algorithmic changes and quantified each of them and their incremental contribution to bottom-line performance. We demonstrate that parallelization alone cannot result in significant gains if the granularity of parallel threads and the effect of parallelization on data locality are not taken into account. Unlike benchmarking studies that often focus on the performance or effectiveness of parallelizing compilers on specific loop kernels, we used the entire CFD code to measure the global effectiveness of compilers and parallel architectures. We probed the performance bottlenecks in each case and derived solutions which eliminate or neutralize the performance inhibiting factors. The major conclusion of our work is that overall performance is extremely sensitive to the synergetic effects of compiler optimizations, algorithmic and code tuning, and architectural idiosyncrasies.},
