\section{Making a reference}
\label{sec: Reference}

\noindent In this chapter we shall do a reference to an entry in the bibliography, \texttt{bibliography.bib}. \\

What we know of the invention of the flux capacitor is that Dr. Emmett Brown thought of this when hanging a clock in the bathroom. He was standing on his porcelain sink and slipped because it was wet, the resulting hit on the head was apparently a cause to this invention \cite{example}.\\

The corresponding sketch made on this day has been attached in appendix \ref{appx: Flux Sketch}.
