Many people contributed to this project's success, and there are a few in particular I'd like to thank.
% Matt Leeke
Firstly my project supervisor, Dr Matthew Leeke, has been a fantastic help throughout the project's development.
He initially helped steer the project in the right direction, decided the title, and gave me pointers on how to research.
% His advice and feedback has always been insightful and helpful, even in response to emails sent 
He's always been quick to give insightful feedback, even when responding to late-night emails, and sets a high academic standard that I will strive to reach throughout the rest of my career.

Next, I'd like to thank the Second Assessor, Dr Sam Agbroko, for attending my presentation and marking this report.
His questions and feedback for the presentation informed the direction of this report, especially the emphasis on novelty.
Thirdly Dr Gavin Stark has always been willing to lend me an ear and bounce my ideas around.
Finally, the rest of my friends and family have all been a great support throughout the project, for which I am very grateful.
