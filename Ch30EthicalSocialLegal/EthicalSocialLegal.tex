\chapter{Ethical, Social, and Legal Issues}
\label{sec:EthicalSocialLegal} 
As stated in the Specification, there are (and continue to be) no ethical or social issues with the development of this simulation and visualization.
The simulation has been derived from code provided to the students for the ACA coursework\cite{modules:CS257Coursework}, which itself is directly derived from a book\cite{book:griebel1998numerical} available at the Warwick Library\cite{ethics:WarwickLibraryFluidSimBook}.

During the development of the visualization, feedback may be gathered as to which elements are most intuitive.
Any such feedback will be restricted to the opinion of friends and family, and as such comes under the category of ``Student projects with primarily an educational purpose''\cite{UniversityofWarwickEthicalConsent}, so does not require ethical review.
This feedback would be gathered according to the University guidelines\cite{ethics:WarwickConsent}, and any gathering will follow the Data Protection Act 2018\cite{ethics:DataProtection2018}.

% Mention BCS Code of Conduct, completely pointless but do it lol
To ensure the work can be trusted, and to maintain professional standards, the BCS Code of Conduct\cite{ethics:BCSCodeOfConduct} has been followed.
Professional standards will continue to be maintained during development, and research performed will be effectively referenced to the same high standard achieved so far.
