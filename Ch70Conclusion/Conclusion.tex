\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion} 
As planned, enough research has been done into the problem space to produce an effectively optimized program.
There has been enough time to think through the design and implementation, and the schedule has been followed well to this point.
Testing, where implemented, has been helpful.
Enough future tests have been planned so that the final program will be robust.

The simulation program and associated state has been shown to fulfil many of the requirements already.
The visualization fulfils the base \cref{req:VizSim}, but not \cref{req:VizSaveState,req:VizManip,req:VizLockedFPS,req:VizFlatOut,req:VizSomeSpeed}.
These will be added next term.
Furthermore, there are possible program extensions listed in \cref{sec:FuturePlansAppendix}.

All in all, this is a very good place to be in with respect to the schedule.
The work done here should allow plenty of time next term to be devoted to the visualization, which should produce a very polished final program, report and presentation.

% \todomark{This should include a brief statement on the current state of the program, 
% how we're doing with respect to the schedule, 
% and a list of things that should be added to the program over Christmas before the visualization development begins.
% Maybe also an optimistic statement on how the project should be high quality once the final deadline hits.
