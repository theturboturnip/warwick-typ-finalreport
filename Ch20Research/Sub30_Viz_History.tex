% Introduce in-situ visualization

One of the earliest CFD interactive visualizations was in 2002, which had a simulation running slower than real time on a separate computer to the real-time visualization\cite{paper:2002vis:10.5555/509740.509745}.
%\todocite{https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/509740.509745}
Decoupling the simulation speed from the visualization speed allowed for high framerates to be achieved for the user interface, however any changes made from the user interface had a delay of 0.5 seconds before being reflected in the simulation.
This qualifies as a loosely-coupled in-situ visualization, because simulation data is streamed to a separate visualization system while the simulation completes.

% Introduce current industrial tools (autodesk CFD, VTK)
A significant open-source toolkit is VTK\todocite{vtk.org}, first introduced in 1993\todocite{Schroeder, Will; Martin, Ken; Lorensen, Bill (2006), The Visualization Toolkit (4th ed.), Kitware, ISBN 978-1-930934-19-1}, which powers multiple tools such as ParaView\todocite{paraview.org} and VisIt\todocite{wci.llnl.gov}.
Both of these programs support tightly-coupled in-situ visualization of an external simulation with plugins, but the VTK base is not well suited to in-situ integration\todocite{https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/Reports/AREA-201703-Kress.pdf}.

Autodesk CFD\todocite{https://www.autodesk.com/products/cfd/overview} is a closed-source tool which integrates its own simulation and visualization together.
It's based on ALGOR FEA, created by ALGOR Inc which was acquired by Autodesk in 2008 \todocite{https://www.mcadcafe.com/nbc/articles/view_article.php?section=Magazine&articleid=637593&printerfriendly=1}.
The latest iteration is targeted at the manufacturing industry, unlike VTK which is a generic toolkit, and does not support in-situ visualization.

Both of the above examples are not built for in-situ visualization, but these programs still represent the industry standard for visualization capabilities.
A novel element of this project is building a program from the ground up for in-situ visualization, and the visualization components will be based on Autodesk.
