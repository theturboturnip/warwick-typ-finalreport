% Before designing the program, understanding the current state of the art is crucial to proper
Effectively optimizing a program requires extensive knowledge of both the program internals and the target platform.
\cref{sec:Research:SimulationTick} describes the mathematics backing the fluid simulation, and \cref{sec:Research:Optimization} describes previous CPU optimizations and state-of-the-art GPU optimization techniques.
\cref{sec:Research:Visualization} then investigates the current standard for visualization techniques and a games industry method for particle simulation, which are used to inform the program requirements and design.

\section{Optimization}
\label{sec:Research:Optimization}
Optimizing simulations is important in all cases, even those that are not real-time, as it allows the engineers using the software to iterate faster on their designs.
When the extra constraint of real-time speeds is added, it becomes even more important.

\section{Visualization}\label{sec:Research:Visualization}
% For the engineers and scientists developing simulations, it is important for a visualization to be completely accurate and show the data in as much detail as possible.
% However there are other groups that may not have as deep of an understanding, but whose actions and decisions should still be informed by the simulation results.

\subsection{Conclusions}
The research outlined so far has established common visualization methods, the potential for composing them together, and a design for an efficient particle simulation.
This was used to design the visualization (\cref{sec:Requirements}) and informed the implementation (\cref{fig:VizDataParticles}).
