\chapter{Research}
\label{sec:Research} 
On top of the preliminary research performed for the Specification document, research of the underlying simulation structure and of the state of the art for optimizing a simulation has been done.
Minor research has been also done for Visualization, although the schedule dictates this should start after Term 1 has ended.

\section{Optimization}
\label{sec:Research:Optimization}
Optimizing simulations is important in all cases, even those that are not real-time, as it allows the engineers using the software to iterate faster on their designs.
When the extra constraint of real-time speeds is added, it becomes even more important.
This research is mostly complete, although more can be done if the simulation needs to get even faster.

\section{Visualization}
For the engineers and scientists developing simulations, it is important for a visualization to be completely accurate and show the data in as much detail as possible.
However there are other groups that may not have as deep of an understanding, but whose actions and decisions should still be informed by the simulation results.
Currently the research is focused on learning lessons from the ACA coursework's provided visualization.
For a visualization to cater to these groups well further research in this space is required.
