\chapter{Project Management}
\label{sec:ProjectManagement}

\section{Software Development Methodology}
Plan-driven solutions depend on a rigid specification being completed before development\cite{modules:CS261}, which does not fit with the more abstract goals of the visualization portion.
Additionally some of the main advantages of plan-driven approaches only apply when introducing new team members and handling large teams.
Neither scenario applies here, as only one person is undertaking active development.

For these reasons, an Agile approach was taken with a development cycle completing every two weeks.
The goals for each development cycle were documented using Trello\cite{tool:Trello}.
It was planned that the supervisor would be contacted every week with the current status of the project and the progress made in the current cycle.
These contacts would either take place over e-mail if there were no pressing questions to ask, and otherwise take place on Microsoft Teams\cite{tool:MicrosoftTeams}.
Unfortunately for the first few weeks this did not happen, as other work was vying for attention and preventing project work from taking place.
This has been resolved in Week 5, and there is now frequent email correspondence.

\section{Project Timeline}
The project was split into multiple tasks to schedule it effectively.
These tasks are scheduled on both a Gantt Chart in \cref{fig:project schedule gantt}, and as a table in \cref{tab:project schedule table}.
The timeline has been well followed, and this schedule has been left unchanged from the Specification. 
Note that over the Christmas break no work is scheduled, this is to allow time on the other courseworks the researcher will have due over that period.

Also note that the development of the visualization and optimization of the simulation are scheduled concurrently - this is to account for the fact that some strides in visualization may require extra optimizations to run in real-time.
Both of these blocks end on Week 22, where development is then completely focused on the presentation.

\section{Tools}
\label{sec:ProjManagementTools}
\verb|gcc 9+|\cite{tool:Gcc9} is used to compile the program.
This version has stable support for the C++14 and C++17 standards\cite{tool:GccCxxStatus}, allowing modern techniques to be used in the program.
CMake\cite{tool:Cmake} is used to handle building the program source files.
Versions 3.8 and up support CUDA as a first-class language\cite{tool:CmakeCUDAFirstClass}, which simplifies the compilation process.
The CLion IDE\cite{tool:CLion} is used on the researcher's personal machine, as the researcher is familiar with the other IDEs in this family.
If DCS machines are used, GNU Emacs\cite{tool:Emacs} will be used to edit files instead.

Git\cite{tool:Git} is used for source control, synchronized to a private GitHub\cite{tool:GitHub} repository to avoid data loss.
\LaTeX{}\cite{tool:Latex} is used to create the various reports and non-program deliverables required by the project, which are hosted on Overleaf\cite{tool:Overleaf} so they can be accessed on Windows and Linux without an installed \LaTeX{} environment.
 
%Trello
Trello\cite{tool:Trello} is used to track bugs and upcoming features in each development cycle.
Google Drive\cite{tool:GoogleDrive} is used to host other documents, i.e. scanned notes, that have been generated during development.

\section{Risk Management}
As the project continues, there are risks that may impede progress and even prevent the project from succeeding.
Being aware of these risks allows them to be predicted ahead of time, avoided, or in the worst case mitigated once they arrive.
Risk can be calculated with the following equation, where Severity and Likelihood are graded between 1 and 5.
\begin{equation*}
    Risk = Severity * Likelihood
\end{equation*}

Some of these risks have been encountered, including a new risk (Other Pressures) which was not accounted for in the Specification.
Thankfully this risk did not cause a large delay.

\subsection{Misscheduling}
It is possible that the features outlined in \cref{sec:Requirements} are too great to be implemented in the allotted time.
In that case, the quality of work may have to be reduced to meet deadlines, or the schedule may need to be changed.
This is especially relevant to the Visualization portion of the project, which cannot be fully scheduled yet.

\textbf{Risk} = 2 * 2 = 4

\textbf{Avoidance:}
Previous projects should be used as a yardstick to predict how long implementing features will take, and inform the schedule.
As new Visualization features are discussed, the impact on timing they each have should be considered.

\textbf{Contingency:}
The scope of the project could be reduced to allow the report to be completed in time.
A ``code freeze'' will be implemented close to the presentation deadline to ensure enough time is spent polishing the presentation and report.

\subsection{Other Pressures}
While the project schedule may have been well estimated based on the work required for the project, the amount of work required for other modules may be larger than expected.
This manifested in Term 1, where the researcher took more modules than usual. 
Additionally, the removal of in-person lectures due to COVID-19 led to a lack of overall structure, which made organizing the other work more difficult.

\textbf{Risk} = 2 * 1 = 2

\textbf{Avoidance:}
A more balanced set of modules between Term 1 and Term 2 could have helped resolve this, however on the other side of the coin the researcher now has fewer modules in Term 2 so this is unlikely to happen again.
Next term the researcher will try to maintain a schedule for working on other module content, which should make up for a lack of in-person lectures.

\textbf{Contingency:}
As before, the scope of the project could be reduced to allow the report to be completed in time.
If module work is taking more time than expected by week 20, the code freeze could be pulled forwards to week 20 or 21 to spend more time on the presentation.


\subsection{Loss of Hardware Access}
As noted in \cref{sec:Requirements_HardwareSoftware}, a GPU is required for the project to be tested and developed.
Currently, the main development environment used is the researcher's personal computer, which has a suitable GPU.
However, if this computer breaks down or is stolen, there is no readily available alternate environment.
Under normal circumstances the Department of Computer Science labs would be used instead, as they also have suitable GPUs, but the current virus situation prevents this.

\textbf{Risk} = 5 * 1 = 5

\textbf{Avoidance:}
Not possible.

\textbf{Contingency:}
Student insurance could be used to purchase a new GPU/computer if it is stolen.
Failing this, the DCS clusters could be used, but these will likely have high contention from other students who need to use GPUs remotely.

\subsection{Illness}
It is always prudent to consider the possibility that the stakeholders may fall ill and be unable to work on the project for some time.
This is exacerbated by the current situation with COVID-19, making potential illnesses more dangerous than usual.

This risk manifested during Week 7, and delayed work on the project by three days.
However the bulk of the current work had been completed by that point, and mostly other modules were affected.

\textbf{Risk} = 4 * 2 = 8

\textbf{Avoidance:}
Not possible.

\textbf{Contingency:}
The schedule would need to be changed to account for lack of time spent working.
Some requirements may need to be reduced or removed entirely.
